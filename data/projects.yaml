    My work with colleagues at EcoHealth in identifying potenial human pathogens
    in wildlife hosts and understanding the dynamics of their circulation and
    spillover.
    This work is and has been funded by a variety of sources including USAID,
    NIH, and DTRA.

    Predictive approaches to understand and predict how veterinary diseases
    spread through the variety of travel and trade pathways, and determining
    how much.  Applying Bayesian approaches such as partial pooling to improve
    predictions by learning across diseases, species, and geographies. This work
    is supported by the DHS Science and Technology Directorate.

software-review:
  title: Peer Review of Scientific Software
  description: >
    Software is a key enabler and output of scientific research, yet academic
    software rarely recieves robust scrutiny and validation. Drawing on best
    practices from both scientific peer review and software engineering,
    rOpenSci has developed a peer-review process for scientific software.
    Now we are expanding this initiative to support other groups in launching
    their own review process, and develop shared community standards and testing
    approaches for statistical algorithms.  This work is supported by the Sloan
    foundation.

  title: Practical Reproducible Workflows for Scientists
  description: >
    One project I work on in this area are contributing to the Rocker Project
    which aims to make it easier for R users to define and store their working
    environments in containers.  Another is the development of projects such as
    `redoc` and `rchie`, which aim to ease the ability of collaborators with
    both programmatic and non-programmatic workflows to
