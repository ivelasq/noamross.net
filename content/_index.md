Hello! I'm Dr. Noam Ross, and welcome to my personal website.  I'm a disease 
ecologist and I study the emergence, dynamics, and spread of wildlife
diseases and how those diseases spill over between species, including into
humans. I'm interested in how to predict these spillovers in time and space,
and in using models that mix mechanistic and non-parametric components to do so.
These days I get to do this work as Principal Scientist for Computational Research
at [EcoHealth Alliance](https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/). 

I am a practitioner and advocate of reproducible research, open science, and
justice and inclusion in my fields. I am a founding editor for software
peer-review at [rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org), and have a variety of projects
related to reproducibility using [R statistical computer
language](https://www.r-project.org/).
