I'm recruiting a Research Software Engineer to join my team at [EcoHealth Alliance](https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/) in New York.  Details and how to apply can be found at <https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/career/research-software-engineer>.  

> EcoHealth Alliance seeks a creative, dedicated, and collaborative research engineer to support infrastructure for a variety of projects in conservation, public health, disease surveillance and reproducible science. The engineer will build and maintain systems to ingest data feeds into databases, analysis pipelines and apps, collect, organize, and disseminate field and laboratory research data, and maintain high-performance computing resources for research teams.
>
> The role will include collaborating closely with data science, field, and laboratory teams working on a variety of projects, including natural language processing, machine-learning, epidemiological simulations, as well as supporting on-the-ground researchers engaged in wildlife disease surveillance and medical anthropology. A successful candidate will actively engage with and collaborate with teams to build tools and expand and improve our capabilities.
>
> EcoHealth Alliance researchers largely use an R-focused analysis stack but use different languages and technologies for infrastructure based on project needs. We value growth and learning, and seek a candidate with enthusiasm to learn new skills and find solutions over a specific checklist of knowledge.
