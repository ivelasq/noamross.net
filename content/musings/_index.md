Hello! I'm Dr. Noam Ross, and welcome to my personal website.  I'm a Senior
Research Scientist and computational disease ecologist at [EcoHealth
Alliance](https://www.ecohealthalliance.org). I study the dynamics of wildlife
diseases and how those diseases spill over between species, including into
humans.  I'm interested in how we predict these spillovers in time and space,
and in using models that mix mechanistic and non-parametric components to do so.

I am a practitioner and advocate of reproducible research, open science, and
justice and inclusion in my fields. I am a founding editor for software
peer-review at [rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org), and have a variety of projects
related reproducibility using [R statistical computer
language](https://www.r-project.org/).
